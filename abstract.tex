\noindent This Final Project examines the design and implementation process for an application that receives HTTP Requests. It will deploy a Helm Chart to help the PT Gudang Ada Globalindo's data team's workflow. The author begins the design process by discussing with the user from the data team to collect requirements; from the discussion, the author also found that the application needs to be integrated with other third-party applications such as Vault, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon S3. The application will receive user requests, apply them to the template, and deploy a Helm Chart with the help of Helm API. After finishing the application development, the author runs nine tests from 10 user requirements. This final project succeeded in designing the application to deploy a Helm Chart that suits the need of GudangAda's data team, implementing the application, and deploying the application in the GudangAda's data team's Kubernetes environment.  \\
